# New SFSU Student Center
## Project Background
More and more students are enrolling in colleges, with a significant number being the first in their families to pursue higher education. As a result, the need for a highly integrated website providing college resources becomes crucial in helping freshmen adapt quickly to college life. While many colleges offer a student center website, they often lack the level of integration required for a seamless experience. For instance, the student center at SFSU fails to integrate with the campus clinic, while the student center at UCSC employs two separate login systems - one for basic school management, such as class enrollment, and another for more advanced processes like tuition payment. Furthermore, several student centers suffer from poor user experience due to security concerns and outdated design.

To address these issues, this project proposes the development of a modernized student center. This enhanced platform would feature a professor ranking system, allowing students to select the most suitable instructors for their classes. Additionally, our student center would integrate club resources, offering support to non-local students as they quickly assimilate into a new community. A survey conducted among SFSU students revealed that over 50% expressed the desire for a new, highly integrated student center.
